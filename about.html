## About

Huan-Cheng Chang is currently working as a software engineer in Singapore. More like an explorer, he's interested in new technologies and he wants to realize inspiring ideas with them to impact the world. Recently he's been working on open-sourced projects using Go and Python. He's also a decent team player that always plays his role well and is willing to share knowledge.

He likes to take photos and dance during his free time. They help a lot in developing creativity. :)
