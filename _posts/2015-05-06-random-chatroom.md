This is our assignment for Embedded Systems Labs (EE3021). We have to design an online chatroom as a practice of JavaScript, so we decided to build a chatroom like [Omegle](http://www.omegle.com/) where users can talk to a random stranger. We've implemented the basic functions of Omegle and tried to make the code cleaner, so we used React.js as our front-end framework, Node.js as our back-end engine with Redis as our database. See our work [here]().
