This is my 2nd project at CKIP, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. We use this system to collect dialogues for our experiments. Users read the instructions, and we'll find a online peer for him/her to start a conversation. After the conversation ends, one peer needs to rate the performance of his/her partner. The frontend is built with **React.js** and **Redux**, and the backend is built with **Express.js**. Also, **Socket.io** is used in this system.
