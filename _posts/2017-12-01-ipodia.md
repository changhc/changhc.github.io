[iPodia](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2017/10/ipodia-power-learning/) is a “global classroom” that eliminates borders, attempting to bring students from all around the world into the same learning space through the power of technology. This is my team project for the Fall 2017 class. The topic is about electric vehicles. Our team consisted of members from 5 countries. We discovered and compared needs in different regions, came up with main product variants, and worked out an optimized global production network.
