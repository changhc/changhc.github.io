[Argo Workflow](https://github.com/argoproj/argo) is an open-source workflow engine written in Go. It allows users to define workflows composed of container-based jobs and orchestrates the running containers. I looked into this project when working at [BasisAI](https://basis-ai.com/) and eventually became a contributor.
