This is our design for [ACM CHI Student Design Competition 2018](https://chi2018.acm.org/authors/student-design-competition/).

We developed a service, “ComAboard”, to reconnect isolated commuters. Through our human-centered research process, we have identified commuters’ discomfort and boredness during their journey and the need to interact with others. With the ComAboard service design, commuters can draw virtual paintings with other passengers and discuss in Taipei Metro. Our design features not only the real time co-creation but also continued connection for commuters. Through this service, commuters might interact, communicate and have a new relationship with each other. We believe ComAboard can liven up people’s commuting experience and encourage them to rethink about what commuting can be like. We also anticipate that this design can be a means to deliver additional positive values.
