Hyper Cook is a smart web-based fridge management system. Users can add/remove ingredients to their fridge, and the system can show them if the ingredients are due soon. Besides, the system can recommend recipes to users according to what they have in their fridge to help them clear the ingredients left. We also constructed a small chatbot through which users can finish the tasks above easier. Built with **ReactJS**, **ExpressJS** and **Microsoft LUIS**.
