[Cofacts](https://hackmd.io/s/BJSdbUMpZ) is a project aims to fight against fake news in Taiwan.

Originated under [g0v](https://g0v.tw/en-US/about.html), a Taiwanese online community devoted to promoting citizen participation, Cofacts is a collaborative system connecting instant messages and fact-check reports together.

To be more specific,
* **Collaborative system**: Anyone can forward messages to Cofacts. Furthermore, *anyone* can become an editor to collaborate on the [website](https://cofacts.g0v.tw/). All works are distributed via [CC0 License](http://creativecommons.tw/cc0).
* **Instant messages**: User-reported instant messages in LINE messaging network, collected via a [chatbot](https://line.me/R/ti/p/%40umn3820l)
* **Fact-check reports**: Existing fact-checking articles the editors found on the internet, or replies written by the editors.
